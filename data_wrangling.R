# The data used in this final assignment is combination of my previously published data about dog 
# and human enzymes, as well as other published articles from the same study object.

# List of references given at the end of the final assignment web page.

# The data was first collected into one excel file. 

#Data wrangling should be done in a separate R-script and included in your repository and a link 
#to that script should be included in you web page. If you are using a data set already processed
# during the course, the script should have clearly commented section(s) which highlight new
# changes you have made to the data. Only these will grant you points for data wrangling.
# The data wrangling script should also include your full name, email, date and a short file
# description and the code should be clearly commented.
