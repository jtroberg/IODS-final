#1.1. Purpose of this analysis

In this final assignment I am comparing the activities of dog and human conjugating enzymes, UDP-glucuronosyltransferases. The comparison of the individual UGT1A and 1a families are published in the paper [Troberg et al., 2015](https://jtroberg.github.io/IODS-final/#and_then_some_more_text "References")
